As you go, you may develop your own R Markdown style you like. I encourage you to download and use the template below at first.

```{r}
library(downloadthis)

download_file(
  path = "assignments/template.Rmd",
  button_label = "Download template.Rmd file",
  button_type = "warning",
  has_icon = TRUE,
  icon = "fa fa-save",
  self_contained = FALSE
)
```
