## Follow along

You can download this .Rmd file below if you'd like to follow along. I do have a few hidden notes you can disregard. This document is a distill_article, so you may want to change to an html_document to knit. You will also need to delete any image references to properly knit, since you won't have those images.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
download_file(
  path = "h2o.Rmd",
  button_label = "Download .Rmd file",
  button_type = "info",
  has_icon = TRUE,
  icon = "fa fa-save",
  self_contained = FALSE
)
```

## Set up

First, we load the libraries we will use. There will be some new ones you'll need to install. You also need to have Java installed - do that [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) first, before installing the `h2o` library. The version needs to be version 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, or 13, and I was required to create an account. You can check to see if you already have java installed by typing `java -version` into the *terminal*. If you do this inside of R, make sure you are in your base directory - you can use the command `cd ..` to move up in your folder structure. After Java is installed, then install `h2o`.

```{r libraries}
library(tidyverse)         # for reading in data, graphing, and cleaning
library(tidymodels)        # for modeling ... tidily
library(lubridate)         # for dates
library(moderndive)        # for King County housing data
library(patchwork)         # for combining plots nicely
library(rmarkdown)         # for paged tables
library(h2o)               # use R functions to access the H2O machine learning platform 
theme_set(theme_minimal()) # my favorite ggplot2 theme :)
```

Then we load the data we will use throughout this tutorial and do some modifications. As I mentioned before, I wouldn't need to take the log here, but I do so I can compare to other models, if desired.

```{r}
data("house_prices")

# Create log_price and drop price variable
house_prices <- house_prices %>% 
  mutate(log_price = log(price, base = 10)) %>% 
  # make all integers numeric ... fixes prediction problem
  mutate(across(where(is.integer), as.numeric)) %>% 
  select(-price, -id)
```

## Introduction

Initiate our H2O instance. This should work without error as long as you have installed one of the Java versions indicated above.

```{r}
h2o.init()
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
h2o.removeAll()
```

You can also go to [http://localhost:54321/flow/index.html](http://localhost:54321/flow/index.html) in a web browser to see the flow. Think of it as us using R to interface with that webpage.

Read data into H2O

```{r}
house_h2o <- as.h2o(house_prices)
```

Split the data into training and testing

```{r}
house_splits <- h2o.splitFrame(data = house_h2o,
                               ratios = c(.75), #prop to training
                               seed = 494)

house_train <- house_splits[[1]]
house_test <- house_splits[[2]]
```

We can list what we have in H2O like this. Although I currently only have three datasets there, this list will contain more than that because when I knit this Rmd file, I will also have fit some models.

```{r}
h2o.ls()
```

And now that I have those data frames in H2O, I could actually do some inspection of them [there](http://localhost:54321/flow/index.html) (this link will only work if you are actually coding along since you will need to have the data loaded there). For example, I can click on `getFrames` and it will give a preview of what is currently in H2O, like in the image below on the right.

![H2O "flow"](h2o_flow.png){width=60%}

:::

::: {}

![getFrames results](getFrames.png){width=100%}

I could even do the modeling there! I'm not going to do that now, but I encourage you to play around with it. 

Now, let's explore some of the models we could use, starting with a random forest. Similar to `tidymodels` or any other modeling framework you might use, there are a lot of options. I won't cover all of them, but you can check them out by searching for `h2o.randomForest` in the help.

In this example, I will do the following:

* Define the outcome variable, y, as `log_price`. I chose not to define the predictor variables, which means it will use everything except the outcome as predictors.  
* Define the training data.  
* Name the model with `model_id` argument.  
* Define the number of folds for k-fold cross-validation.  
* Set a seed for reproducibility.  
* Define the maximum run time in seconds.

```{r}
rf_mod <- h2o.randomForest(y = "log_price",
                           training_frame = house_train,
                           model_id = "rand_for",
                           nfolds = 5,
                           seed = 494,
                           max_runtime_secs = 180)

```

And we can look at summaries of the model fit. Why is the first set different from the last?????????????//

```{r}
print(rf_mod)
```

```{r}
h2o.performance(rf_mod, 
                xval = TRUE)
```

Predict

```{r}
pred_test <- h2o.predict(rf_mod,
                         newdata = house_test)
# make it an R data.frame
as.data.frame(pred_test)
```

Save model

```{r}
h2o.saveModel(rf_mod,
              path = "/Users/llendway/GoogleDriveMacalester/2020FALL/Advanced_DS/ads_website/_posts/2021-04-13-h2o")
```


```{r}
test <- h2o.loadModel(path = "/Users/llendway/GoogleDriveMacalester/2020FALL/Advanced_DS/ads_website/_posts/2021-04-13-h2o/rand_for")

prediction_test <- h2o.predict(test,
                         newdata = house_test)
# make it an R data.frame
as.data.frame(prediction_test)
```


```{r}
h2o.removeAll()
```
