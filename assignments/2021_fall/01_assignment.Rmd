```{r setup, include=FALSE}
#knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE)
```

```{r libraries}
library(tidyverse)         # for graphing and data cleaning
theme_set(theme_minimal()) # Lisa's favorite theme
```

```{r data}
# Read in data here
```

When you finish the assignment, remove the `#` from the options chunk at the top, so that messages and warnings aren't printed. If you are getting errors in your code, add `error = TRUE` so that the file knits. I would recommend not removing the `#` until you are completely finished.

## Setting up Git and GitHub in RStudio

Read the [Quick Intro](https://advanced-ds-in-r.netlify.app/posts/2021-01-28-gitgithub/#quick-intro) section of the Using git and GitHub in R Studio set of Course Materials. Set up Git and GitHub and create a GitHub repo and associated R Project (done for you when you clone the repo) for this homework assignment. Save this file to the project folder. You should always open the R Project (.Rproj) file when you work with any of the files in the project.

**Tasks**:

-   Edit the README file with a brief (1-2 sentences) description of what this repository is for.

-   As you work on the assignment, commit and push changes to your repository.

-   Below, post a link to your GitHub repository - the main page which should show the README is fine.

## Creating a website

You'll be using RStudio to create a personal website to showcase your work from this class! Start by watching the [Sharing on Short Notice](https://youtu.be/QcE4RBH2auQ) webinar by Alison Hill and Desir√©e De Leon of RStudio. This should help you choose the type of website you'd like to create.

Once you've chosen that, you might want to look through some of the other *Building a website* resources I posted on the [resources page](https://advanced-ds-in-r.netlify.app/resources.html) of our course website. If anyone does not want to post a website publicly, please talk to me and we will find a different solution.

**Tasks**:

-   Make sure you create an R Project first and eventually a GitHub repository for your website. I suggest doing it at the beginning. If you have any issues, let me know - I know I ran into issues with my own distill site where I couldn't have a README file.

-   Create a landing page that tells people a little bit about you. You could include what you are studying in school and your career/post-graduation aspirations, a photo, a link to your resume/CV, job/research experiences, and even something about other interests.

-   Add another page where you will add posts. This could be a blog-format or a place you can link to other knitted html documents. You will be posting your Tidy Tuesday assignments on this page.

-   Do some customization! This could be something small, like changing the default theme of an RMarkdown website. Or, it could be something bigger, like digging into the custom CSS of a distill or blogdown site. You should look at other people's website code for inspiration. A starting place might be the [distillery](https://distillery.rbind.io/showcase.html) blog that has links to source code for all those websites.

-   Include a link to your website below.

-   Listen to at least the first 20 minutes of "Building a Career in Data Science, Chapter 4: Building a Portfolio". Go to the main [podcast website](https://podcast.bestbook.cool/) and navigate to a podcast provider that works for you to find that specific episode. Write 2-3 sentences reflecting on what they discussed and why creating a website might be helpful for you.

## Project ideas

Answer the following questions to start thinking about the project.

-   What are some topics (or a single topic) you are interested in studying from a data science perspective? These can be very specific or more general.  

-   Given your to topic(s), where would you find data about it? Provide at least two sources, being as specific as possible. If you need to collect/scrape it yourself, describe the steps you'd need too take.

-   What challenges do you imagine having? How might you overcome them?  

-   Respond to the Project Survey on moodle.

## Bias and Fairness

Listen to Dr. Rachel Thomas's [Bias and Fairness lecture](https://ethics.fast.ai/videos/?lesson=2). Write a brief paragraph reflecting on it. You might also be interested in reading the [ProPublica article](https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing) Dr. Thomas references about using a tool called COMPAS to predict recidivism. Some questions/ideas you might keep in mind:

-   Did you hear anything that surprised you?

-   Why is it important that we pay attention to bias and fairness when studying data science?

-   Is there a type of bias Dr. Thomas discussed that was new to you? Can you think about places you have seen these types of biases?
